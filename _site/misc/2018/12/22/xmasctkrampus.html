Solution Writing help we discover that Krampus is simply a Python 2.7 interpreter, so we need to find a bug in some function in order to exploit it. Playing a bit with him we can see that we can use chr(), input(), print(), eval() and some useless functions, but none of these with strings, dots, commas, underscores, etc.. After a lot of time we figure out that the right strategy is to use eval() encoding the string as a concatenation of chr() results.

<p>Writing <code class="highlighter-rouge">help</code> we discover that Krampus is simply a Python 2.7 interpreter, so we need to find a bug in some function in order to exploit it. Playing a bit with him we can see that we can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">chr(), input(), print(), eval()</code> and some useless functions, but none of these with strings, dots, commas, underscores, etc..</p>

<p>After a lot of time we figure out that the right strategy is to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">eval()</code> encoding the string as a concatenation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">chr()</code> results.</p>

<p>Again, after some trial and error we found that <code class="highlighter-rouge">eval(chr(95)+chr(95)+chr(105)+chr(109)+chr(112)+chr(111)+chr(114)+chr(116)+chr(95)+chr(95)+chr(40)+chr(39)+chr(111)+chr(115)+chr(39)+chr(41)+chr(46)+chr(108)+chr(105)+chr(115)+chr(116)+chr(100)+chr(105)+chr(114)+chr(40)+chr(39)+chr(46)+chr(39)+chr(41))</code> works and lists the files in Krampus’ directory (it is <code class="highlighter-rouge">eval("__import__('os').listdir('.')")</code>).

Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">eval("open('server.properties').read()")</code> (obviously encoded as before) we found this</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#Minecraft server properties

<p>So it is a Minecraft server! From now, we spent about an hour to try to encode in base64 the server and download it, but it was too big and he stopped answering after a few seconds. Then we tried to run the server on Krampus’ as a jar file, but nothing happened. Then we had the idea that it was a real Minecraft server, so we donwloaded the client and… It worked!</p>

<p>From now, it was only 90 painful minutes of playing minecraft to find the flag in the map.</p>
